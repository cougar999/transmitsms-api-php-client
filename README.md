# TransmitsSMS API PHP Client
A basic old PHP class for potentially simplifying the use of TransmitSMS API endpoints.

# Usage
Download the APIClient2.php file and locate somewhere in your application directory structure.
Add the following lines to your PHP script.

> sorry, we don't support composer, yet.

    <?php
    include 'APIClient2.php';
    
    $api = new transmitsmsAPI('API_KEY', 'API_SECRET');

Replace `'API_KEY'` and `'API_SECRET'` with your account credentials.

See examples folder for endpoint usage examples.
